# R-R_Studio-Shiny-Differential-Gene-Expression

Used R in R-Studio to create a web application with the help of the "Shiny Library"
&nbsp;

My main interest here was trying this Shiny library but not really dive into it deeply.  I'd rather use Flask for Python websites (and there is a way to channel R through there too if needed).   I was going through a small-course on this.  There was the science of "Differential Gene Expression" presented at the same time; however, I'm not sure it is 100% accurate.  It may be, I just haven't evaluated it yet.

Below is what the webpage looks likeâ€”again, just using R-Studio.  Shiny also works with Python.  By-the-way, there are column headers on top of the table; but, the dark theming I'm trying out here is hiding them.   I was trying various themes.

There were various genes available in the dropdown menu:
